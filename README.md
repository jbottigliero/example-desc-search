# Example: LSSTDESC Search Portal

This is an example search portal built for the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time ([LSST](https://www.lsst.org/)), Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) – https://lsstdesc.org/.

The repository provides the necessary configuration to enable funtionality similiar to the current, managed, Python-based portal: https://data.lsstdesc.org/.


This implementation differs from https://github.com/jbottigliero/example-desc in that is uses a Globus Search Index to help aid in the discovery of datasets.
